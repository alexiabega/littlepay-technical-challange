# LittlePay Technical Test
 I have created a very simple aplication that when it runs, it prints the famous "Hello world!" when accessing it at http://localhost:5000 .

 There are multiple alternatives for you to run this application:

 ### Option 1: Simple Local Run
(If you want to use this option you have to make sure you have Python insalled on your local machine)
 Install Python dependencies:
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 Run the application:
 ```bash
 python app.py
 ```
